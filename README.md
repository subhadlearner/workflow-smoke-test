# Project Name

Briefly describe the project.

## Purpose

This repository is a reusable production-grade AI-assisted software-engineering template.

The project-specific technology stack is selected during `/architect` and synchronized into the repository during `/project-init`.

## Development Workflow

The standard lifecycle is:

1. `/grill` when discovery is needed (optional)
2. `/prd`
3. `/architect`
4. `/project-init`
5. `/spec`
6. `/implement`
7. `/verify`
8. `/review`

For difficult defects use `/diagnose → /fix → /verify`.

For high-risk decisions use `/adversarial-check` or the automatic risk-triggered checks inside architecture/specification work.

The complete flow is:

```text
/grill (optional)
  ↓
DISCOVERY_READY
  ↓
/prd
  ↓
PRD_READY
  ↓
/architect
  ├─ ARCHITECTURE_BLOCKED → resolve as directed → /architect
  └─ ARCHITECTURE_READY
            ↓
      /project-init
  ├─ PROJECT_INIT_BLOCKED → resolve as directed
  └─ PROJECT_INIT_READY
            ↓
          /spec
  ├─ SPEC_BLOCKED → resolve as directed
  └─ SPEC_READY
            ↓
       /implement
  ├─ IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKED → resolve as directed
  └─ RUN_VERIFY
            ↓
         /verify
  ├─ NOT_DONE → /fix → /verify
  └─ DONE
       ↓
     /review
       ↓
DeepSeek pre-review
  ├─ CHANGES_REQUIRED → /fix → /verify → /review
  └─ READY_FOR_SENIOR_REVIEW
                   ↓
            GPT-5.6 Sol senior review
  ├─ REQUEST CHANGES → /fix → /verify → /review
  └─ APPROVE
       ↓
       CI
       ↓
   PR / merge
       ↓
human-approved production deployment
```

Blocked workflow stages must report the blocker, its owner, the minimum required action, and the exact next command.

## Technology Ownership

The major technology baseline is chosen during:

`/architect`

That includes, where applicable:

- application language/runtime
- framework
- persistence technology
- cloud/provider/region
- infrastructure as code
- testing stack
- code-quality tooling
- CI/CD approach

`/project-init` does not independently choose the stack.

It synchronizes the approved architecture into:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `.kilo/rules/`
- `.kilo/skills/`

If required technology decisions are missing, `/project-init` must stop instead of guessing.

## Repository Structure

```text

├── AGENTS.md
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── .kilo/
│   ├── rules/

    ├── prd/
    ├── architecture/
    ├── adr/
    ├── specs/
    ├── reviews/
    └── verification/
```

Project-local concurrent worktrees may use `.kilo/worktrees/`, which is intentionally ignored by Git.

## Branch and Worktree Workflow

Each specification should be implemented on its own branch.

Preferred naming:

`spec/<spec-id>-<short-description>`

Example:

`spec/SPEC-001-create-short-url`

Do not implement directly on protected integration branches such as:

- `main`
- `master`
- `develop`
- `release`

For parallel implementation:

- use separate branches
- use separate Git worktrees
- avoid concurrent mutation of the same files

`/fix`, `/verify`, and `/review` continue on the existing implementation branch.

They do not create another branch for the same specification.

Merge should happen through the normal PR/CI process.

## Discovery, TDD, Diagnosis, and Adversarial Checks

Use `/grill` before PRD work when an idea is large, ambiguous, or contains coupled decisions. Confirmed discovery is written under `docs/discovery/` and becomes input to `/prd`.

Specifications define stable observable test seams and whether TDD is applicable. When applicable, `/implement` uses behavioral red → green vertical slices rather than writing tests only after implementation.

Use `/diagnose` when a defect is difficult to reproduce or localize. It creates a red-capable feedback loop before root-cause claims and may persist a concise report under `docs/diagnostics/`.

Use `/adversarial-check` for high-risk architecture/specification/migration/security decisions. DeepSeek Flash is the default adversary. You may explicitly request Claude Sonnet for a paid cross-model second opinion or Claude Opus for a premium critical review; a user-directed request authorizes that specific invocation without a prior DeepSeek pass or GPT-5.6 Sol justification. It is not a substitute for `/verify`, `/review`, CI, or human approval.

## Project Skills

Project-scoped skills are stored under:

`.kilo/skills/`

Skills should only be added when they materially improve implementation quality.

Preference order:

1. official/vendor-maintained skills
2. reputable community skills
3. adapted project-specific skills
4. custom skills only when necessary

Third-party skills must be reviewed and explicitly approved before installation.

Do not install large or unrelated skill collections.

## Verification and Repair

Implementation is not ready for review until `/verify` returns:

`DONE`

Normal repair flow:

For a hard defect whose cause is not established:

```text
/diagnose
   ↓
DIAGNOSIS_READY
   ↓
/fix
   ↓
/verify
```

For implementation verification:

```text
/implement
   ↓
RUN_VERIFY
   ↓
/verify
   │
   ├── DONE ─────────────→ /review
   │
   └── NOT_DONE
          ↓
        /fix
          ↓
       RUN_VERIFY
          ↓
        /verify
```

`/fix` is also used when review finds blocking issues:

```text
CHANGES_REQUIRED or REQUEST CHANGES
                ↓
              /fix
                ↓
             /verify
                ↓
             /review
```

`/verify` is the authoritative deterministic completion gate.

It must validate all required applicable checks and provide deterministic evidence for the specification's acceptance criteria.

## Choosing the Model Per Workflow

For product-design commands, you can choose the model directly in the prompt.

Examples:

```text
/grill I want to build a finance platform for Indian retail investors. Grill me. Use GPT.

/grill I want to build a finance platform for Indian retail investors. Grill me. Use Claude.

/architect Use Terra.

/spec Use Haiku.

/adversarial-check Use Opus directly for this review.
```

Supported aliases include GPT/Sol, Terra, Luna, Claude/Sonnet, Haiku, Opus, and DeepSeek.

If no model is named, the default routing below applies.

The model choice changes the intelligence provider, not the workflow's permissions or authority.

Kilo's Task Subagent Model Selection feature must remain enabled for natural-language routing to a different subagent model.

## Model Routing

The default workflow uses:

- GPT-5.6 Sol for discovery, PRD, architecture, specification design, adversarial reconciliation, and senior review
- GPT-5.6 Luna for project initialization and lightweight repository/documentation work
- DeepSeek Flash for implementation, verification, repair, diagnosis, default adversarial checks, and pre-review
- Claude Sonnet as an optional paid independent second opinion
- Claude Opus as an optional premium rare-critical escalation

GPT-5.6 Sol/Luna use the connected ChatGPT subscription in Kilo; Claude Sonnet/Opus consume the separate Anthropic API budget.

Do not reduce relevant context merely to save tokens. Remove irrelevant context, not required context.

## Review Model

The review pipeline is cost-controlled:

1. DeepSeek performs the first-pass pre-review.
2. GPT-5.6 Sol runs only when pre-review returns `READY_FOR_SENIOR_REVIEW`.
3. CI remains the deterministic merge gate.
4. Production deployment still requires human approval.

The AI review results are:

- pre-review: `READY_FOR_SENIOR_REVIEW` or `CHANGES_REQUIRED`
- senior review: `APPROVE` or `REQUEST CHANGES`

## CI and Merge

The approved architecture defines the CI/CD approach.

A greenfield project should include an explicit specification for repository/bootstrap work when CI/CD, IaC bootstrap, or project scaffolding does not yet exist.

CI should enforce the applicable:

- build
- unit/integration/E2E tests
- lint/format/static analysis
- security/dependency checks
- IaC validation

Do not bypass CI to merge implementation changes.

## Production Deployment

Production deployment is never implied by an AI `APPROVE` result.

The required order is:

```text
AI review APPROVE
      ↓
CI passes
      ↓
PR / merge
      ↓
explicit human production approval
      ↓
production deployment
```

## Getting Started

For a new project:

1. clone or copy this template
2. replace the project name and description
3. run `/grill` if the product idea is still broad/ambiguous; otherwise start at `/prd`
4. proceed through the workflow in order
5. let `/project-init` populate the actual technology and build/test commands after architecture is approved

Do not manually fill technology choices that have not yet been approved by the architecture stage.
